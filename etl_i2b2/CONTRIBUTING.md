## SQL Style and Conventions

SQL is written in lowercase, indented 2 spaces. More details are in
the evolving kumc-bmi-sql-style.xml sqldeveloper style profile.

TODO: 120 chars max.
TODO: line break before ;

Each script should start with a header comment and some
dependency-checking queries. See `script_lib.py` for details.
